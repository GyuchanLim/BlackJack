## What the game can do now
- Able to play a full game (Manually)

## What I want the game to do
- Able to play the game only as the player (Automatic dealer)

## Out of topic things
- Try to find ways to make [autoload](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html) work
  - Manage some deck variables via autoload
  - Track the amount of wins/losses/pushes?
- Come up with your own rules (Completely different game)
